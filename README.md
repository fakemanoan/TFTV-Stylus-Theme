# TFTV-Stylus-Theme
Stylus/Stylish/Custom CSS for teamfortress.tv to make it look like it wasnt made in 2009. Dark mode for extra points.

Based on the styling of the vlr.gg site, also created by engima.

This is a WIP for now. End goal is to release it on userstyles.org or something.

# TODO
custom svg flags âœ“ <br>
better tables <br>
clean up of css

# EXTRA TODO
Tampermonkey script<br>
better match column<br>

# UNREALISTIC BUT COOL IDEAS
better streams section <br>
teams (lol) <br>
global search like vlr.gg (lol)<br>

# Known Issues
Improper scaling (ie 125%, 175%) causes top navbar lines to be weird. Nothing I can really do to make this look good (is the same on vlr.gg). So dont use 125% scaling, ya dunce!
