# TODO

TFTV post

# EXTRA TODO

# UNREALISTIC BUT COOL IDEAS
better streams section <br>
better match column <br>

global search like vlr.gg (lol) <br>

# Known Issues
- Improper scaling (ie 125%, 175%) causes top navbar lines to be weird. Nothing I can really do to make this look good (is the same on vlr.gg). So dont use 125% scaling, ya dunce!
- the code is a mess. ill clean it up eventually, promise
